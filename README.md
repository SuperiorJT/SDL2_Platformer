# SDL2_Platformer
This is an experimental platformer.
## How To Run ##
Currently, I only have this runnning on OS X and have not tested it on other OS's. In order to run this game on your machine, you will need to install SDL2 and compile this code (in this case, through XCode).
I plan on making this cross-platform, both for ease of access to updating code and just because I would like to run it on the 3 major OS's.

##### If anybody has advice or questions about this code, email me at superiorjt@gmail.com with the subject "SDL2_Platformer Questions/Advice."
